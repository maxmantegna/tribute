          A barrel of oil is cheaper than a 99-cent Big Gulp. Georgia announced
          that its top priority is to open up the bowling alleys. Quibi …
          exists. The world is weird, and the only things weirder than it are
          the alternate dimensions spun by Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim in
          series like Awesome Show, Great Job! and Bedtime Stories. Now they
          have a sitcom on Adult Swim, and it’s both totally out of time and
          somehow of-the-moment. <br />

            Beef House</a
          >
          puts Tim and Eric in the traditional sitcom setup of being roommates,
          alongside Eric’s wife, a hardworking police detective played by
          Jamie-Lynn Sigler. Beef House wears its Full House inspiration on its
          sleeve, only instead of filling the house with lovable scamps and
          charming uncles, it’s full of character actors from Tim and Eric’s
          stable of weird, middle-age talent: men like the bowl-cut Tennessee
          Luke, foul-mouthed Ron Auster, and sex pervert Ben Hur. The laugh
          track still sets off on cue and goes “Aww” at heartwarming moments,
          but the plots revolve around feces spray, stabbings, and spoiled eggs.
          We chatted with Tim and Eric about the new series and how they’re
          doing while quarantining in their respective beef homes.
